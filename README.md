Atelier Expérimentation Project for 2018/2019

## Tools

The tools used for this project are:

PscyhoPy Version 1.85.6 (the newest version should work)

R Version

R Toolboxs: "dplyr", "purrr", "ggplot2", and "reshape2"

## Experimental Program

### Functions

## Experiment Run

## R Simulation

## R Analysis

## Conclusion

### Final Remarks

Programming Level - Intermediate

Programming related learning - How to create a simulation, How to run a Linear Mixed Model in R on my own data, About Pages in Github, about Pandas in Python, About the "Reshape2" package and "melt" function for R, Using Github for a real project and not just a one time homework assignment

Non-Programming related learning - Zipf's Law, Benford's law, How difficult it is to conduct an experiment (unaccounted for factors, unwanted subject behavior, lost data, etc.), The importance of backing up data (learned the hard-way)

Regarding the course: I was not a typical student in the course, having taken Aterlier d'Experimentation last year. One thing that hampered me was the difficulty in having internet, so often I could not access the classes Github in class, or access online materials to help me. Also, there were not enough outlets in the room for computers. It sounds silly but these are really important for a computer class.

Sometimes when I followed the material it was a little fast for me. I had already done many of the things before, but actually typing and getting it to run and solving it on your own takes time and I felt like I was in a race at times. When you (Professor Pallier) wrote on the chalkboard it was nice because I had the time to program but also pay attention.

Compared with AE, and especially the "mois de rentrée" this class was far better for improving programming skills. I learned far more during the project this semester, than the project for AE I completed last year. Besides the outlets and plugs, I think this course should have 2 projects. A midterm and a final. And I think the midterm should be a small experiment students try to run, something very simple, to give them gratification for having done something physical but also to show how difficult running and experiment can be.

## Extra Material

There is extra material contained within the github respository. 

(1) "/Images/Instructions.jpg" - This contains an image used to teach subjects how to determine their dominant eye. It was used in the experiment.

(2) "/Data/Texts.docx" - A document with all texts used in the experimnet with corresponding position and group labels.

(3) "/Data/Example_subject.txt" - Contains an examplary data file from a subject

(4) "/Data/DataStructure.xlsx" - Excel sheet for the planned data structure for subject data
