# Reading Speed

PCBS Project 2018/2019

The aim of this project was to create a Reading Speed experiment in PsychoPy and to run it on twenty subject and analyze the results. Due to issues in experimental implementation, a Reading Speed Simulator was built in R, and an analysis involving visualizations of the simulated data and the creation of a linear mixed model was carried out.

## Repository Layout

In this Github repository would will find the programs and documentation necessary to carry out the Reading Speed Experiment, Reading Speed Simulator, and Reading Speed Analysis.

[Analysis](https://github.com/jvgiordano/PCBS-ReadingSpeed/blob/master/Analysis) Contains the Reading Speed Simulator and Analysis of the simulation

[Data](https://github.com/jvgiordano/PCBS-ReadingSpeed/blob/master/Data) Contains the data recorded while running the Reading Speed Experiment using PsychoPy

[Images](https://github.com/jvgiordano/PCBS-ReadingSpeed/blob/master/Images) Contains an image used for instructing subjects

[Experiment_0_0_2.py](https://github.com/jvgiordano/PCBS-ReadingSpeed/blob/master/Experiment_0_0_2.py) is the experimental program that is run in PsychoPy

## Tools

The tools used for this project are:

PscyhoPy Version 1.85.6 (the newest version should work)

R Version 3.2.3

R Toolboxs: "dplyr", "purrr", "ggplot2", and "reshape2"

## Experiment Run

Running the experiment proved to be more difficult than anticipated. Several problems were encountered concering the design and build of the experiment. The first of these were typos found by the subjects during the experiment which had an observable effect on the reading times for those trials. Even after all 8 subjects had completed the experiment, other typos were found, but it is unknown how these errors affected reading speed.  The second issue was that the questions, though designed to be simple and often did not require the reading of the text to answer, still received many wrong responses. This was most notable for non-native speakers. The questions failed here because they did not ensure the subjects read the questions, and at the same time, were too difficult for most subjects to answer completely correctly.

Other issues with the experiment are related to subject behavior and conditions. I failed to take into account the effect being a native English speaker would have. Non-native speakers took far longer, and with apparent variability, to read the texts and answer the questions. Due to the initial group A and B design, the non-native speakers would have probably had an over influential role on the data and hidden any effects of eye dominancy. Second, subjects were not informed of the timed readings. They only knew about the questions and some became overly concerned with this aspect of the test. I was told by several subjects that they read the texts "three to four times" to ensure they would remember all the details and to have fully understood it. This of course greatly affects reading time.

Last, there were some technical issues. 2 of the data sets were lost. They still have files associated with the subjects which can be found in the respository under subject initials of "PR" and "JY", but the files are empty. Initially I thought the cause was from shutting down the computer while the text file was still opened after reviewing it after an experiment. Later I determined the cause was by launching the experiment with the same subject initials, even if the experiment wasn't carried out. Just starting the experiment wiped the recorded information.

Because of all of these issues, and time constaints, running the experiment was ended in lieu of creating a reading speed simulator in R.

## R Simulation

Because of the troubles running the experiment, a Reading Speed Simulation was created in R. This model took into account effects discovered while running the experiment and so was a more evolved form of it in some ways. Because of time constraints, it was simplified. For instance, the model has no variables to account for "Nonfiction" and "Fiction"  task, but it does have a parameter to account for text difficulty.

The R code for the simulation can be found in /master/Analysis/scripts as ["Reading_Speed_Simulator.R"](https://github.com/jvgiordano/PCBS-ReadingSpeed/blob/master/Analysis/scripts/Reading_Speed_Simulator.R) (or you can click the link)

## R Analysis

The full R analysis can be found in the R markdown document can be found in master/Analysis/write_up as ["reading_speed_markdown.html"](https://github.com/jvgiordano/PCBS-ReadingSpeed/blob/master/Analysis/write_up/reading_speed_markdown.html) (or you can click the link).

There is an alternative PDF version [here](https://github.com/jvgiordano/PCBS-ReadingSpeed/blob/master/Analysis/write_up/reading_speed_markdown.pdf)

The data for the analysis can be found in master/Analysis/data [here.](https://github.com/jvgiordano/PCBS-ReadingSpeed/blob/master/Analysis/data/data.txt)


## Conclusion

I learned a lot from this project, both programming and experience wise. I had only ever used R from data analysis, but never for creating a simulation or for Linear Mixed Models with my own data. I didn't know about pandas in Python either, but quickly realized how strong R is with matrix and table maniupulations. I also got to use Github for a project, and not just a one time thing for a homework.

Carrying out the experiment I programmed in PsychoPy was also enlightening. There were many factors I had failed to account for, and it made me appreaciate how difficult it is to conduct a good experiment. This is something I will think about for future experiments I might have to design as well as papers I will read.

### Final Remarks

Programming Level - Intermediate

Programming related learning - How to create a simulation, How to run a Linear Mixed Model in R, About Pages in Github, about Pandas in Python, About the "Reshape2" package and "melt" function for R, Using Github for a real project and not just a one time homework assignment

Non-Programming related learning - Zipf's Law, Benford's law, How difficult it is to conduct an experiment (unaccounted for factors, unwanted subject behavior, lost data, etc.), The importance of backing up data (learned the hard-way, multiple times)

Regarding the course: I was not a typical student, having taken Atelier d'Experimentation last year. One thing that hampered me was the difficulty in having internet, so often I could not access the Github in class, or access online materials to help me. Also, there were not enough outlets in the room for computers, and my PC could never last the entire class. It sounds silly but these are really important for a computer class.

Sometimes when I followed the material it was a little fast for me. I had already done many of the things before, but actually typing and getting it to run and solving it on your own takes time and I felt like I was in a race at times. When you (Professor Pallier) wrote on the chalkboard it was nice because I had the time to program but also pay attention.

Compared with AE, and especially the "mois de rentr√©e" this class was far better for improving programming skills. I learned far more during the project this semester, than the project for AE I completed last year. Besides the outlets and plugs, I think this course should have 2 projects. A midterm and a final. And I think the midterm should be a small experiment students try to run, something very simple, to give them gratification for having done something physical but also to show how difficult running and experiment can be.

I'm pleasantly surprised with how much I learned from this class.

## Extra Material

There is extra material contained within the github respository. 

(1) "/Images/Instructions.jpg" - This contains an image used to teach subjects how to determine their dominant eye. It was used in the experiment.

(2) "/Data/Texts.docx" - A document with all texts used in the experimnet with corresponding position and group labels.

(3) "/Data/Example_subject.txt" - Contains an examplary data file from a subject

(4) "/Data/DataStructure.xlsx" - Excel sheet for the planned data structure for subject data
